Respect\Foundation
==================

A minimalistic project template for us and for everyone featuring PHPUnit, PEAR, Pirum and Travis CI support.

Features
========

Run `make help` on the project root to see usage information.

  * Conventional PHPUnit configuration and bootstrap
  * Environment set up tools that track dependencies via PEAR
  * An easy to use automated PEAR packager
  * A Github-ready Pirum channel manager (similar to http://respect.li/pear/)
  * Conventional Travis CI configuration;

Installation (beta!)
====================

Our remote installer is just plain awesome. Make sure you have GNU make and 
PEAR installed, then run:

`wget git.io/Makefile && make foundation`

This will also upgrade Foundation on pre-existing projects, but this isn't fully
tested, so be careful.
